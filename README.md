# Little Login Manager

![](https://github.com/Cottin/little-login-manager/blob/master/docs/llm1.gif)

If you're joggling lots of accounts to test software or for other reasons and think the existing Password Management software is too complex, try out this super-simple apple script!

## Keyboard short-cut to the login manager
Use for instance Spark (http://www.shadowlab.org/Software/spark) to bind a keyboard shortcut to execute the account manager.

## Disclamer
To save account information (including passwords) in an applescript is a bad security practice! This little tool is only meant to be used for unimportant accounts such as testing accounts used in test environments when developing software.
